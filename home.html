                            Tasks are grouped into knowledge areas. Business analysts perform tasks from all the knowledge areas sequentially, iteratively, or simalteaneiouly. The BABOK Guide does not perscribe a process or an order in which tasks are performed. Tasks may be performed in any order, as long as the necessary inputs to a task are present. A business analysis initiative may start with any task, although likely candidates are <em>Analyze Current State</em> or <em>Measure Solution Performance</em>.
